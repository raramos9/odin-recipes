                <li> 1/2 cup (120ml) water. </li>

            </ul>
        <h2><strong>STEPS </strong></h2>
            <ol> 
                <li> In a large bowl, add in all the chicken (thighs and drumsticks)
                     and the heavily crushed cloves of garlic.</li>
                <li> To that add a fresh crack of black pepper, black peppercorns, palm sugar, 
                    unseasoned rice vinegar, dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, filtered water, 
                    and toss together and add in bay leaves. </li>
                <li> Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for 2 hours, or ideally
                     overnight. **Reserve all marinated liquid**</li>
                <li> Set a large braiser or dutch oven over medium-high heat and coat with 
                    oil to cover the pan.  </li>
                <li> Sear all the chicken in batches on all sides for 2-3 minutes per side.
                     Place each batch to the side once done browning to avoid overcrowding.</li> 
                <li> Add marination to the pan (without the chicken) along with all the aromatics.
                     Increase the heat to medium-high and add the chicken pieces
                      to the pan in layers and bring to a boil. </li>
                <li> Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let simmer (covered) 
                    for 35 minutes. Uncover and flip the chicken pieces, cover them again, and cook
                     for another 25-35 more minutes. Turn chicken over occasionally to thoroughly coat 
                     and the sauce thickens and a glaze. </li>
                <li> Place the chicken on a plate of rice topped with green onions.
                     Spoon on as much sauce as desired. </li> 
            </ol>
